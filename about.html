    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    <div class="scrollable-textarea">
        The objectives of the Nepal Food Security Dashboard are to enhance transparency regarding food markets in Nepal by offering data and insights on key commodities, to support data-driven decision-making for policymakers and other stakeholders, and to facilitate more in-depth analysis.  In addition, the Dashboard aims to monitor trends in food prices to inform planning, identify unusual price shocks and their likely causes, foster collaboration among stakeholders, and disseminate relevant information through monthly bulletins.
